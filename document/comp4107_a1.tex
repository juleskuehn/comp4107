\item Question 4\newline
Implementation for question 4 can be found in q4.py. The only learning rate that will work is when $Îµ = 0.01$, which will lead to the correct result with $\approx 420$ iterations. The other ones won't work as we are descending too quickly, and therefore we will miss the correct answer and failed to come back. We set the program to stop
