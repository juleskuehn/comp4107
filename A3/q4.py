"""
Using Principal Component Analysis (PCA) and scikit-learn face data compare the classification accuracy of faces when using this orthonormal basis as input to a feed forward neural network when compared to using the raw data as input features. You are expected to document (a) the size of your feed forward neural network in both cases and (b) the prediction accuracy of your neural networks using a K-fold analysis. Experimental investigation over a range of network sizes and parameters is expected.
